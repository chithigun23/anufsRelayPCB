# Engine Shutoff Safety System â€“ 6-Relay PCB

## Overview

This project involves the design and development of a custom PCB that controls six relays as part of an engine shutoff safety system for a Formula Student race car. The system is a critical component of the vehicle's overall electrical safety and is designed to ensure that the engine can be safely and reliably disabled in an emergency.

## Features

- **Six Relay Outputs**: Current rated components and appropriate PCB traces.
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Uses normally open relays
- **Compact Layout**: Designed for minimal space in a tight race car.
